        <h4>Assignment One 10/10/2022</h4>
        <p>The first assignment didn't take long to put together, I am pretty familiar with HTML.
            It was a good refresher assignment though, I forgot some things like how to set up nested
            lists and what to put in the head and body. I also forgot how to open the index.html on Google
            Chrome, but figured it out pretty quickly. So, I wouldn't say I had too many challenges. Mainly
            just had to jog my memory on some things. The things that helped me the most were looking at
            the index.html that we made in class, and reffering to the Github that told us how to set up
            the assignment. Also, I checked Campuswire a few times as well!
        </p>

        <h4>Assignment Two 10/24/2022</h4>
        <p>This assignment was definitely more challenging then the first. The first issue I ran into was
            not giving myself enough time to go over small details. In the end, I had to be okay with letting
            minor issues go. I forgot how frustrating CSS can be. I really struggled with getting the display right
            for the images, the ones with two lines of text for the description are out of line compared to the other
            ones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things I had to google was the button shadowing, it's called box-shadow. And I also forgot how to curve
            borders. I also looked more into flexbox. I used the CSS examples from class as well, mainly the one that went
            over responsiveness when a browser changes size. I also looked up different colors so I could match the mocks better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned that I need to give myself more time on assignments. Even if I think it won't take long, something
            usually goes wrong. Or something takes longer than I think it will. It was also a really good refresher course
            for CSS in general. I used to do it a lot for my job but it's been a few years. I was mainly refreshed on how to display
            certain things, and how important padding and margins are. Also, testing in the browser is <b>vital!!!</b> Testing one thing
            at a time and seeing it what it does, then adding it my code.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Assignment Three 11/07/2022</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? 
                What I found challenging was trying to build the new posts from the input fields, trying to vision how it would flow and make sure that
                it went last nefore all other posts. Honestly, I read some stuff on MDN and also went through part of the Eloquent Chapters. I also looked
                at the class Examples, even though we didn't get into that part much. It was a lot of consoling logging and working through error messages.</li>

            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                A lot of it was review for me but I honestly forgot more than I thought I did. It's been almost 5 years since I worked on JavaScript and
                I thought some parts would come back easier than they actually did. The DOM manipulation is where I struggled most. I think it's because I 
                learned React pretty early on to be able to handle stuff like that, so doing it this way is more of a challenge. I already knew a lot about
                Event Handlers and JS in general, like syntax rules and general stuff like that. It was all the "firstChildElement.firstChildElement.firstChild.Element"
                that was the challenge for me.</li>

            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? 
                The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
                I re-watched the JS lectures, I looked at the source code on Github, I read the literature provided and I read the class notes which actually helped 
                a lot as well. I also read a lot on MDN and Stack Overflow about how to mainpulate the DOM and grab certain elements.</li>

                <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                I had to google how to grab answers from the conditions, how I could know whether it was checked 'new, excellent, good, fair, used.' That one took
                a while until I found the checked attribute. Also, I learned A LOT about how to manipulate nodes and elements, and how to insert new ones in certain
                places, depending on where you want them.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Assignment Four 11/14/2022</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
                I've done a lot of request, response stuff before in the past but it has been years, and between using express and React, I kind
                of forgot how to do it the vanilla node.js way. It took a lot of re-learning and feeling really crazy for forgetting so many things.
                But I definitely had some muscle memory once I started going. The one thing that helped was knowing how to read through some crazy Docs. 
                I had a problem at first when I just wanted to test to see if I could get the serve started up and running, it kept saying that whatever
                port number I was running, was in use. I think I just had a mistake somewhere. So, I deleted everything and just started working on the
                assignment, and the problem went away.
            </li>

            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                I think I re-learned a lot of things, mainly just the basic of node.js and how to use fs and http. I forgot about writing response headers 
                too. I kept thinking about all of the separte requests (GET, PUT, PATCH, etc.) and I kept getting confused about how I was supposed to do
                this and that it had nothing to do with that. That we already had the files we needed and didn't need any more information added.
                Honestly, I read the class notes and looked at the examples on Github, and looked throug the examples on the Docs. But yeah, it was 
                a great refresher for sure, just how to do simple request/responses with node.js, without using tools like express and stuff.
            </li>

            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? 
                The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
                Lectures, class notes, exmaples on Github, the Docs, exmaples of how to do requests online like on w3schools and Stack Overflow.
            </li>

            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                I really had to look into how to do the response headers, the example code on Github helped and Stack Overflow. Then I also looked up how
                to write a jpg because I didn't know if response.write would work. I honestly relied on the class notes and examples a lot, in order to format
                the requests and responses right.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Assignment Five 11/28/2022</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
                I think it the most challenging part of this assignment was trying to conceptualize how it all was put together in the end. I kept getting
                tripped up on small details, like where certain templates or pages were getting the data needed and if it made sense. I also spent
                a lot of time on the app.get requests and responses once I templated the code. I had to look at several examples online.
            </li>

            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                I learned a lot about handlebars and how it all works together. I knew about JSOn, but it was definitely a refresher for me. It was
                nice re-learning about some server-side stuff that can be accomplished using JSON, and how to edit package.json to be able to run specific
                commands.
            </li>

            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? 
                The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
                I re-watched the class videos a couple of times, I also looked at the Class Notes and Github. I also used Stack Overflow for a few things,
                like the insertAdjacentHTML, because I wasn't writing it properly at first. Google really helped with using express and handlebar templates.
            </li>

            <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                How to properly use insertAdjacentHTML, and how to use app.get to render all the pages. I was confused because in the class example, the JSON
                data that is provided has nested arrays that are named, and the data we had did not have that. So, I was confused about how to access that. 
                After googling different stuff, I realized I could just take the whole array by calling postData.
