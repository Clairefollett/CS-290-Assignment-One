        <h4>Assignment One 10/10/2022</h4>
        <p>The first assignment didn't take long to put together, I am pretty familiar with HTML.
            It was a good refresher assignment though, I forgot some things like how to set up nested
            lists and what to put in the head and body. I also forgot how to open the index.html on Google
            Chrome, but figured it out pretty quickly. So, I wouldn't say I had too many challenges. Mainly
            just had to jog my memory on some things. The things that helped me the most were looking at
            the index.html that we made in class, and reffering to the Github that told us how to set up
            the assignment. Also, I checked Campuswire a few times as well!
