        <h4>Assignment One 10/10/2022</h4>
        <p>The first assignment didn't take long to put together, I am pretty familiar with HTML.
            It was a good refresher assignment though, I forgot some things like how to set up nested
            lists and what to put in the head and body. I also forgot how to open the index.html on Google
            Chrome, but figured it out pretty quickly. So, I wouldn't say I had too many challenges. Mainly
            just had to jog my memory on some things. The things that helped me the most were looking at
            the index.html that we made in class, and reffering to the Github that told us how to set up
            the assignment. Also, I checked Campuswire a few times as well!
        </p>

        <h4>Assignment Two 10/24/2022</h4>
        <p>This assignment was definitely more challenging then the first. The first issue I ran into was
            not giving myself enough time to go over small details. In the end, I had to be okay with letting
            minor issues go. I forgot how frustrating CSS can be. I really struggled with getting the display right
            for the images, the ones with two lines of text for the description are out of line compared to the other
            ones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things I had to google was the button shadowing, it's called box-shadow. And I also forgot how to curve
            borders. I also looked more into flexbox. I used the CSS examples from class as well, mainly the one that went
            over responsiveness when a browser changes size. I also looked up different colors so I could match the mocks better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned that I need to give myself more time on assignments. Even if I think it won't take long, something
            usually goes wrong. Or something takes longer than I think it will. It was also a really good refresher course
            for CSS in general. I used to do it a lot for my job but it's been a few years. I was mainly refreshed on how to display
            certain things, and how important padding and margins are. Also, testing in the browser is <b>vital!!!</b> Testing one thing
            at a time and seeing it what it does, then adding it my code.
