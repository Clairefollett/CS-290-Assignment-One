        <h4>Assignment One 10/10/2022</h4>
        <p>The first assignment didn't take long to put together, I am pretty familiar with HTML.
            It was a good refresher assignment though, I forgot some things like how to set up nested
            lists and what to put in the head and body. I also forgot how to open the index.html on Google
            Chrome, but figured it out pretty quickly. So, I wouldn't say I had too many challenges. Mainly
            just had to jog my memory on some things. The things that helped me the most were looking at
            the index.html that we made in class, and reffering to the Github that told us how to set up
            the assignment. Also, I checked Campuswire a few times as well!
        </p>

        <h4>Assignment Two 10/24/2022</h4>
        <p>This assignment was definitely more challenging then the first. The first issue I ran into was
            not giving myself enough time to go over small details. In the end, I had to be okay with letting
            minor issues go. I forgot how frustrating CSS can be. I really struggled with getting the display right
            for the images, the ones with two lines of text for the description are out of line compared to the other
            ones. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things I had to google was the button shadowing, it's called box-shadow. And I also forgot how to curve
            borders. I also looked more into flexbox. I used the CSS examples from class as well, mainly the one that went
            over responsiveness when a browser changes size. I also looked up different colors so I could match the mocks better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned that I need to give myself more time on assignments. Even if I think it won't take long, something
            usually goes wrong. Or something takes longer than I think it will. It was also a really good refresher course
            for CSS in general. I used to do it a lot for my job but it's been a few years. I was mainly refreshed on how to display
            certain things, and how important padding and margins are. Also, testing in the browser is <b>vital!!!</b> Testing one thing
            at a time and seeing it what it does, then adding it my code.

        <h4>Assignment Twp 11/07/2022</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? 
                What I found challenging was trying to build the new posts from the input fields, trying to vision how it would flow and make sure that
                it went last nefore all other posts. Honestly, I read some stuff on MDN and also went through part of the Eloquent Chapters. I also looked
                at the class Examples, even though we didn't get into that part much. It was a lot of consoling logging and working through error messages.</li>

            <li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                A lot of it was review for me but I honestly forgot more than I thought I did. It's been almost 5 years since I worked on JavaScript and
                I thought some parts would come back easier than they actually did. The DOM manipulation is where I struggled most. I think it's because I 
                learned React pretty early on to be able to handle stuff like that, so doing it this way is more of a challenge. I already knew a lot about
                Event Handlers and JS in general, like syntax rules and general stuff like that. It was all the "firstChildElement.firstChildElement.firstChild.Element"
                that was the challenge for me.</li>

            <li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? 
                The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
                I re-watched the JS lectures, I looked at the source code on Github, I read the literature provided and I read the class notes which actually helped 
                a lot as well. I also read a lot on MDN and Stack Overflow about how to mainpulate the DOM and grab certain elements.</li>

                <li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                I had to google how to grab answers from the conditions, how I could know whether it was checked 'new, excellent, good, fair, used.' That one took
                a while until I found the checked attribute. Also, I learned A LOT about how to manipulate nodes and elements, and how to insert new ones in certain
                places, depending on where you want them.</li>
        </ol>
