                worked as a Web Developer for a software company in Opal. This was in 2017-2018. I worked there for
                about a year before I moved to the Coast. It was a super fun job, I maintained the website and managed
                a lot of the marketing such as creating automated emails and creating demos on our website. I also made
                a blog for marketing related blog posts. Prior to that, I went to a coding boot camp to learn JavaScript.</li>
